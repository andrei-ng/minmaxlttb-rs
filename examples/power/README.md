## Power Dataset

Demonstrate MinMaxLTTB on a real-world power consumption dataset.

The dataset used is `Individual household electric power consumption` (UCI Machine Learning Repository): [household_power_consumption.zip](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00235/household_power_consumption.zip).

The dataset is downloaded on first run to `examples/assets/household_power_consumption.txt`.

Running the example will generate a `Plotly` plot that is saved in the `output` folder and automatically open in your system's default browser.
