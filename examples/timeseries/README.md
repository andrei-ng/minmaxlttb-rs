## Synthetic Timeseries

Demonstrates LTTB downsampling on a synthetic timeseries. The dataset used is the one used by the [lttb-bench](https://github.com/cpbotha/lttb-bench/) repository which has been downloaded in to `examples/assets/timeseries.csv`.

Running the example will generate a `Plotly` plot that is saved in the `output` folder and automatically open in your system's default browser.
